BUILD  A  TEMPERATURE  CONVERSION                                              
PROGRAM
aim:-To explain about  build a temperature conversion program?
explanation:-
1.Function Definitions:
The program starts by defining functions for converting between different temperature units: Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celsius, Celsius to Kelvin, Kelvin to Celsius, Fahrenheit to Kelvin, and Kelvin to Fahrenheit. These functions encapsulate the conversion logic for each unit.
2.Menu Function:
print_menu() function prints out the menu options for the user to choose from.
3.Main Program Loop:
The main() function sets up a loop that keeps running until the user chooses to quit.
Inside the loop, the menu is printed, and the user is prompted to enter their choice.
4.User Input Handling:
The program checks the user's choice. If it's 7, the program quits. If it's between 1 and 6, it proceeds with temperature conversion.
If the choice is invalid, the program asks the user to enter a valid choice.
5.Temperature Conversion:
If the user's choice is valid (between 1 and 6), the program prompts the user to enter the temperature they want to convert.
The program then tries to convert the input temperature to a float (a numerical value), and if successful, it performs the conversion based on the user's choice using the appropriate conversion function.
6.Output:
After performing the conversion, the program prints the result to the user, indicating the original temperature and the converted temperature along with their respective units.
7.Error Handling:
If the user enters a non-numerical value for the temperature, the program catches the ValueError exception and prompts the user to enter a valid temperature.
8.Exiting the Program:
If the user chooses to quit (option 7), the program prints a goodbye message and exits the loop, ending the program execution.
9.Main Function Invocation:
The program then calls the main() function to start the execution of the temperature conversion program.
10.Execution:
When the program is executed, it begins by displaying the menu.
The user selects an option, enters a temperature, and the program converts it accordingly.
This process repeats until the user chooses to quit.
By following this step-by-step process, the program provides a user-friendly interface for performing temperature conversions efficietily
